# About

This is a (work in progress) presentation on the Mapper algorithm by Nathaniel Saul.  It presents mapper in the context of the Reeb graph and attempts to motivate it's usefulness to non-or-new-mathematicians.

This presentation was made with [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/), [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

# Post-talk notes

---


Notes:

## Physical presentation

* Talk louder
* Talk slower
* Use less vocal fillers (how do you practice this?)

Need more practice

## Content
* Show the picture *and then* give the definition
  - definition is not as important as the intuition

* Spend more time describing each of the pieces so it is clearer

* Mention how difficult it is to construct these and how much time it takes, these are the final found result

* Mention how it is used beside other algorithms

* Mention the higher dimensional construction

## Expand for DS talk
* Spend more time explaining how the examples have been built.  
* Describe some of the tools that can be used
* show the example of a mapper applied to pca
* talk more about dimensionality reduction and show examples of ways they fail that TDA is useful.
*

ome of the tools that can be used? - this would be more interesting for DS people.
