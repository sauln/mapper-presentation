With the rise of computers has come an era of big data.  Larger and more complicated
than anything dealt with before, many traditional methods of exploratory data analysis
fail to extract any useful insights from the growing mountains of bytes.  
In this light, researchers have begun to look deep into the world of pure mathematics
for new tools that could applicable.
By making the simple assumption that data has an underlying shape,
the world of algebraic topology becomes a ripe field of theory and methods for extracting
insights.

In this talk, we will detail the Reeb graph, a useful object for capturing
topologically important aspects of a shape.  We will then move onto its discrete
counterpart, the Mapper, which has been shown to be a particularly useful construction
for exploring high dimensional point cloud data.

Concepts of this talk will be presented at an undergraduate level and will be of
interest to anyone that likes pretty visualizations of big data.
